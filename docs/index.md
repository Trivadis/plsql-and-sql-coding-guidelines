In the I.T. world of today, robust and secure applications are becoming more and more important. Many business processes no longer work without I.T. and the dependence of businesses on their I.T. has grown tremendously, meaning we need robust and maintainable applications. An important requirement is to have standards and guidelines, which make it possible to maintain source code created by a number of people quickly and easily. This forms the basis of well functioning off- or on-shoring strategy, as it allows quality assurance to be carried out efficiently at the source. 

Good standards and guidelines are based on the wealth of experience and knowledge gained from past (and future?) problems, such as those, which can arise in a cloud environment, for example.<br/>

The Oracle Database Developer community is made stronger by resources freely shared by experts around the world, such as the Trivadis Coding Guidelines. If you have not yet adopted standards for writing SQL and PL/SQL in your applications, this is a great place to start.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

It is a matter of fact, that code is more often read than written – therefore we should take efforts to ease the work of the reader, which is not necessarily the author.

I am convinced that this standard may be a good starting point for your own guidelines.<br/><br/><br/>

## Revision History

The first version of these guidelines was compiled by Roger Troller on March 17, 2009. Jörn Kulessa, Daniela Reiner, Richard Bushnell, Andreas Flubacher and Thomas Mauch helped Roger complete version 1.2 until August 21, 2009. This was the first GA version. The handy printed version in A5 format was distributed free of charge at the DOAG Annual Conference and on other occasions. Since then Roger updated the guidelines regularily. Philipp Salvisberg was involved in the review process for version 3.0 which was a major update. Philipp took the lead, after Roger left Trivadis in 2016. In 2020 Kim Berg Hansen started handling guidelines maintenance, letting Philipp concentrate on the related [Trivadis db* CODECOP](https://cdn.trivadis.com/downloads/dbCODECOP-fs-en.pdf) tool.

Since July, 7 2018 these guidelines are hosted on GitHub. Ready to be enhanced by the community and forked to fit specific needs. 

On [https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-and-sql-coding-guidelines/releases](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-and-sql-coding-guidelines/releases) you find the release information for every version since 1.2.
