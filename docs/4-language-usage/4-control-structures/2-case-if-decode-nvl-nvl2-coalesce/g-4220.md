# G-4220: Try to use CASE rather than DECODE.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability, Portability

## Reason

`decode` is an ORACLE specific function hard to understand and restricted to SQL only. The “newer” `case` function is much more common, has a better readability and may be used within PL/SQL too. Be careful that `decode` can handle `null` values, which the simple `case` cannot - for such cases you must use the searched `case` and `is null` instead.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
-- @formatter:off
select decode(dummy, 'X', 1 
                   , 'Y', 2
                   , 'Z', 3
                        , 0)
  from dual;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select case dummy
          when 'X' then
             1
          when 'Y' then
             2
          when 'Z' then
             3
          else
             0
       end
  from dual;
```

## Example (bad)

``` sql
-- @formatter:off
select decode(dummy,  'X',  1 
                   ,  'Y',  2
                   , null, -1
                         ,  0)
  from dual;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select case
          when dummy = 'X' then
             1
          when dummy = 'Y' then
             2
          when dummy is null then
             - 1
          else
             0
       end
  from dual;
```
