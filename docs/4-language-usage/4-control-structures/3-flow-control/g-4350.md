# G-4350: Always use 1 as lower and COUNT() as upper bound when looping through a dense array. 

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Reliability

## Reason

Doing so will not raise a `value_error` if the array you are looping through is empty. If you want to use `first()..last()` you need to check the array for emptiness beforehand to avoid the raise of `value_error`.

Please note that:

* Varrays are always dense
* Associative arrays (or index-by tables) are either dense or sparse
* Nested tables start dense and may become sparse

## Example (bad)

``` sql
declare
   type t_employee_type is table of employees.employee_id%type;
   t_employees t_employee_type := t_employee_type();
begin
   <<process_employees>>
   for i in t_employees.first()..t_employees.last()
   loop
      sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i)); -- some processing
   end loop process_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (better)

Raise an unitialized collection error if `t_employees` is not initialized.

``` sql
declare
   type t_employee_type is table of employees.employee_id%type;
   t_employees t_employee_type := t_employee_type();
begin
   <<process_employees>>
   for i in 1..t_employees.count()
   loop
      sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i)); -- some processing
   end loop process_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

Raises neither an error nor checking whether the array is empty. `t_employees.count()` always returns a `number` (unless the array is not initialized). If the array is empty `count()` returns 0 and therefore the loop will not be entered.

``` sql
declare
   type t_employee_type is table of employees.employee_id%type;
   t_employees t_employee_type := t_employee_type();
begin
   if t_employees is not null then
      <<process_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employees.count()
      loop
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i)); -- some processing
      end loop process_employees;
   end if;
end;
/
```
