# G-4375: Always use EXIT WHEN instead of an IF statement to exit from a loop. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

If you need to use an `exit` statement use its full semantic to make the code easier to understand and maintain. There is simply no need for an additional `if` statement.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
declare
   co_first_year constant pls_integer := 1900;
begin
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      my_package.some_processing();

      if extract(year from sysdate) > co_first_year then
         exit process_employees; -- violates also G-4365
      end if;

      my_package.some_further_processing();
   end loop process_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
declare
   co_first_year constant pls_integer := 1900;
begin
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      my_package.some_processing();

      exit process_employees when extract(year from sysdate) > co_first_year;

      my_package.some_further_processing();
   end loop process_employees;
end;
/
```
