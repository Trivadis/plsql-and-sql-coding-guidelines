# G-4375: Always use EXIT WHEN instead of an IF statement to exit from a loop. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

If you need to use an `EXIT` statement use its full semantic to make the code easier to understand and maintain. There is simply no need for an additional IF statement.

## Example (bad)

```
DECLARE
   co_first_year CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 1900;
BEGIN
   <<process_employees>>
   LOOP
      my_package.some_processing();
      
      IF EXTRACT(year FROM SYSDATE) > co_first_year THEN
         EXIT process_employees;
      END IF;
      
      my_package.some_further_processing();
   END LOOP process_employees;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

```
DECLARE
   co_first_year CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 1900;
BEGIN
   <<process_employees>>
   LOOP
      my_package.some_processing();
      
      EXIT process_employees WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) > co_first_year;
      
      my_package.some_further_processing();
   END LOOP process_employees;
END;
/
