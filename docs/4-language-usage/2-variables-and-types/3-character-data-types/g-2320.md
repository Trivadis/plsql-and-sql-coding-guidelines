# G-2320: Never use VARCHAR data type.

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Portability, Reliability

## Reason

Do not use the `varchar` data type. Use the `varchar2` data type instead. Although the `varchar` data type is currently synonymous with `varchar2`, the `varchar` data type is scheduled to be redefined as a separate data type used for variable-length character strings compared with different comparison semantics.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package types_up is
   subtype description_type is varchar(200);
end types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package types_up is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200 char);
end types_up;
/
```
