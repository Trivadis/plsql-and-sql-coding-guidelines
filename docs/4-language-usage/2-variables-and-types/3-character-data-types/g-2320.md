# G-2320: Avoid using VARCHAR data type.

!!! warning "Major"
    Portability

## Reason

Do not use the `VARCHAR` data type. Use the `VARCHAR2` data type instead. Although the `VARCHAR` data type is currently synonymous with `VARCHAR2`, the `VARCHAR` data type is scheduled to be redefined as a separate data type used for variable-length character strings compared with different comparison semantics.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package types_up is
   subtype description_type is varchar(200);
end types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package types_up is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200 char);
end types_up;
/
```
