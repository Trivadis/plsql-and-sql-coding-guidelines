# G-2310: Avoid using CHAR data type.

!!! warning "Major"
    Reliability

## Reason

`CHAR` is a fixed length data type, which should only be used when appropriate. `CHAR` columns/variables are always filled to its specified lengths; this may lead to unwanted side effects and undesired results.

## Example (bad)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE types_up 
IS
   SUBTYPE description_type IS CHAR(200);
END types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE types_up 
IS
   SUBTYPE description_type IS VARCHAR2(200 CHAR);
END types_up;
/
```
