# G-2340: Always define your VARCHAR2 variables using CHAR SEMANTIC (if not defined anchored).

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Reliability

## Reason

Changes to the `nls_length_semantic` will only be picked up by your code after a recompilation.

In a multibyte environment a `varchar2(10)` definition may not necessarily hold 10 characters when multibyte characters are part of the value that should be stored, unless the definition was done using the `char` semantic.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="2"
create or replace package types_up is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200);
end types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="2"
create or replace package types_up is
   subtype description_type is varchar2(200 char);
end types_up;
/
```
