# G-2510: Avoid using the LONG and LONG RAW data types.

!!! warning "Major"
    Portability

## Reason

`long` and `long raw` data types have been deprecated by Oracle since version 8i - support might be discontinued in future Oracle releases.

There are many constraints to `long` datatypes in comparison to the `lob` types.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package example_package is
   g_long long;
   g_raw long raw;

   procedure do_something;
end example_package;
/

create or replace package body example_package is
   procedure do_something is
   begin
      null;
   end do_something;
end example_package;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package example_package is
   procedure do_something;
end example_package;
/

create or replace package body example_package is
   g_long clob;
   g_raw  blob;

   procedure do_something is
   begin
      null;
   end do_something;
end example_package;
/
```
