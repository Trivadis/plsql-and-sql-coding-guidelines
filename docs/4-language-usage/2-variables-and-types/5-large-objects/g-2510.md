# G-2510: Avoid using the LONG and LONG RAW data types.

!!! warning "Major"
    Portability

## Reason

`LONG` and `LONG RAW` data types have been deprecated by ORACLE since version 8i - support might be discontinued in future ORACLE releases.

There are many constraints to LONG datatypes in comparison to the LOB types.

## Example (bad)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE example_package IS
   g_long LONG;
   g_raw  LONG RAW;
   
   PROCEDURE do_something;
END example_package;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY example_package IS
   PROCEDURE do_something IS
   BEGIN 
      NULL;
   END do_something;
END example_package;
/
```

## Example (good)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE example_package IS
   PROCEDURE do_something;
END example_package;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY example_package IS
   g_long CLOB;
   g_raw  BLOB;
   
   PROCEDURE do_something IS
   BEGIN 
      NULL;
   END do_something;
END example_package;
/
```
