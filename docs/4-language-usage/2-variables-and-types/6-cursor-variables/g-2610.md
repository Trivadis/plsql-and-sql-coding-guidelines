# G-2610: Never use self-defined weak ref cursor types.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Changeability, Maintainability, Portability, Reusability

## Reason

There is no reason to define your own weak ref cursor types, as they are not different from the built-in `sys_refcursor`. Introducing your own types just gives you unnecessary maintenance to perform.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
declare
   type local_weak_cursor_type is ref cursor;
   cv_data local_weak_cursor_type;
begin
   if configuration.use_employee then
      open cv_data for
         select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name
           from employees e;
   else
      open cv_data for
         select e.emp_id,e.name
           from emp e;
   end if;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
declare
   cv_data sys_refcursor;
begin
   if configuration.use_employee then
      open cv_data for
         select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name
           from employees e;
   else
      open cv_data for
         select e.emp_id,e.name
           from emp e;
   end if;
end;
/
```
