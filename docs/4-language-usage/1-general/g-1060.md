# G-1060: Avoid storing ROWIDs or UROWIDs in database tables.

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Reliability

## Reason

It is an extremely dangerous practice to store `rowid`'s in a table, except for some very limited scenarios of runtime duration. Any manually explicit or system generated implicit table reorganization will reassign the row's `rowid` and break the data consistency.

Instead of using `rowid` for later reference to the original row one should use the primary key column(s).

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="6 11"
begin
   insert into employees_log (
      employee_id
     ,last_name
     ,first_name
     ,rid
   )
   select employee_id
         ,last_name
         ,first_name
         ,rowid
     from employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
begin
   insert into employees_log (
      employee_id
     ,last_name
     ,first_name
   )
   select employee_id
         ,last_name
         ,first_name
     from employees;
end;
/
```
