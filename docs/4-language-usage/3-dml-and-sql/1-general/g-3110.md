# G-3110: Always specify the target columns when coding an insert statement.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Reliability

## Reason

Data structures often change. Having the target columns in your insert statements will lead to change-resistant code.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
insert into departments
values (
   departments_seq.nextval
  ,'Support'
  ,100
  ,10);
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
insert into departments (department_id
  ,department_name
  ,manager_id
  ,location_id)
values (
   departments_seq.nextval
  ,'Support'
  ,100
  ,10);
```
