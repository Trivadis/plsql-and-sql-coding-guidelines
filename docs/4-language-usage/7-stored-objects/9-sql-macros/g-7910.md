# G-7910: Never use DML within a SQL macro.

!!! danger "Critical"
    Reliability, Testability

## Restriction

Oracle Database 21c (19c from version 19.7 for table macros alone)

## Reason

Doing DML (except for `select`) within a SQL macro can lead to disastrous side effects from calling the macro in a SQL query.

Logging macro calls via a call to a procedure that does DML in an autonomous transaction can be an exception to the rule.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace function row_generator (
   num_rows_in in number(32,0)
)
   return varchar2 sql_macro as
begin
   insert into function_calls(name, called_at, parameter_value)
      values ($$PLSQL_UNIT, current_timestamp, num_rows_in);
   commit;
   
   return 'select level as row_sequence from dual connect by level <= num_rows_in';
end row_generator;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace function row_generator (
   num_rows_in in number(32,0)
)
   return varchar2 sql_macro as
begin
   return 'select level as row_sequence from dual connect by level <= num_rows_in';
end row_generator;
/
```
