# G-7460: Try to define your packaged/standalone function deterministic if appropriate.

!!! warning "Major"
    Efficiency

## Reason

A deterministic function (always return same result for identical parameters) which is defined to be deterministic will be executed once per different parameter within a SQL statement whereas if the function is not defined to be deterministic it is executed once per result row.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="3"
create or replace package department_api is
   function name_by_id(in_department_id in departments.department_id%type)
      return departments.department_name%type;
end department_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="3 4"
create or replace package department_api is
   function name_by_id(in_department_id in departments.department_id%type)
      return departments.department_name%type
      deterministic;
end department_api;
/
```
