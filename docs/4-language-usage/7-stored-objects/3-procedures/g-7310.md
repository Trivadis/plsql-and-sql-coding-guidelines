# G-7310: Avoid standalone procedures – put your procedures in packages.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

Use packages to structure your code, combine procedures and functions which belong together.

Package bodies may be changed and compiled without invalidating other packages. This is a major advantage compared to standalone procedures and functions.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="1"
create or replace procedure my_procedure is
begin
   null;
end my_procedure;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="7"
create or replace package my_package is
   procedure my_procedure;
end my_package;
/

create or replace package body my_package is
   procedure my_procedure is
   begin
      null;
   end my_procedure;
end my_package;
/
```
