# G-7510: Always prefix ORACLE supplied packages with owner schema name.

## Characteristics

Security

## Severity

Major

## Reason

The signature of oracle-supplied packages is well known and therefore it is quite easy to provide packages with the same name as those from oracle doing something completely different without you noticing it.

## Example (bad)

```
DECLARE
   co_hello_world CONSTANT STRING(30 CHAR) := 'Hello World';
BEGIN
   dbms_output.put_line(co_hello_world);
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

```
DECLARE
   co_hello_world CONSTANT STRING(30 CHAR) := 'Hello World';
BEGIN
   sys.dbms_output.put_line(co_hello_world);
END;
/
```
