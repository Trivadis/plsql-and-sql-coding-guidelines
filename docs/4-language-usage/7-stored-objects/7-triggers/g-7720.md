# G-7720: Never use multiple UPDATE OF in trigger event clause.

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Maintainability, Reliability, Testability

## Reason

A DML trigger can have multiple triggering events separated by `or` like `before insert or delete or update of some_column`. If you have multiple `update of` separated by `or`, only one of them (the last one) is actually used and you get no error message, so you have a bug waiting to happen. Instead you always should use a single `update of` with all columns comma-separated, or an `update` without `of` if you wish all columns.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace trigger dept_br_u
before update of department_id or update of department_name -- violates also G-7730
on departments for each row
begin
   -- will only fire on updates of department_name
   insert into departments_log (
      department_id
     ,department_name
     ,modification_date)
   values (
      :old.department_id
     ,:old.department_name
     ,sysdate);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace trigger dept_br_u
before update of department_id,department_name
on departments for each row
begin
   insert into departments_log (
      department_id
     ,department_name
     ,modification_date)
   values (
      :old.department_id
     ,:old.department_name
     ,sysdate);
end;
/
```
