# G-7125: Always use CREATE OR REPLACE instead of CREATE alone.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

Using `create` alone makes your scripts give an error if the program unit already exists, which makes the script not repeatable. It is good practice to use `create or replace` to avoid such errors.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create package body employee_api is
   function employee_by_id(in_employee_id in employees.employee_id%type)
      return employees%rowtype is
      r_employee employees%rowtype;
   begin
      select *
        into r_employee
        from employees
       where employee_id = in_employee_id;

      return r_employee;
   exception
      when no_data_found then
         null;
      when too_many_rows then
         raise;
   end employee_by_id;
end employee_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package body employee_api is
   function employee_by_id(in_employee_id in employees.employee_id%type)
      return employees%rowtype is
      r_employee employees%rowtype;
   begin
      select *
        into r_employee
        from employees
       where employee_id = in_employee_id;

      return r_employee;
   exception
      when no_data_found then
         null;
      when too_many_rows then
         raise;
   end employee_by_id;
end employee_api;
/
```
