# G-7150: Try to remove unused parameters.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency, Maintainability

## Reason

You should go through your programs and remove any partameter that is no longer used.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create or replace package body department_api is
   function name_by_id (in_department_id in departments.department_id%type
                       ,in_manager_id    in departments.manager_id%type)
      return departments.department_name%type is
      l_department_name departments.department_name%type;
   begin
      <<find_department>>
      begin
         select department_name
           into l_department_name
           from departments
          where department_id = in_department_id;
      exception
         when no_data_found or too_many_rows then 
            l_department_name := null;
      end find_department;
      
      return l_department_name;
   end name_by_id;
end department_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create or replace package body department_api is
   function name_by_id (in_department_id in departments.department_id%type)
      return departments.department_name%type is
      l_department_name departments.department_name%type;
   begin
      <<find_department>>
      begin
         select department_name
           into l_department_name
           from departments
          where department_id = in_department_id;
      exception
         when no_data_found or too_many_rows then 
            l_department_name := null;
      end find_department;
      
      return l_department_name;
   end name_by_id;
end department_api;
/
