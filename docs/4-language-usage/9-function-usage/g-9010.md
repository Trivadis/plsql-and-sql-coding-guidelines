# G-9010: Always use a format model in string to date/time conversion functions.

!!! warning "Major"
    Changeability, Maintainability, Reliability, Security, Testability

## Reason

Converting from strings to `date` or `timestamp` datatypes (using `to_date`, `to_timestamp`, `to_timestamp_tz` or `cast` to any of those datatypes) in practice always expects a fixed format (unlike converting *to* strings that can be fixed as well as allow the session to decide). Therefore it is a bad idea to allow this conversion to rely on the session NLS settings (`nls_date_format`, `nls_timestamp_format` and `nls_timestamp_tz_format`) as this makes the code vulnerable to changes in session and/or server configuration. It is even possible to utilize session `nls_date_format` for SQL injection if you use dynamic SQL.

Using an explicit format model for string to `date` or `timestamp` conversion avoids this inappropriate dependability on configurable NLS parameters.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
create package body employee_api is
   procedure set_dob (in_employee_id in employees.employee_id%type, in_dob_str in varchar2) is
   begin
      update employees
      set date_of_birth = to_date(in_dob_str)
      where employee_id = in_employee_id;
   end set_dob;
end employee_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
create package body employee_api is
   procedure set_dob (in_employee_id in employees.employee_id%type, in_dob_str in varchar2) is
   begin
      update employees
      set date_of_birth = to_date(in_dob_str, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
      where employee_id = in_employee_id;
   end set_dob;
end employee_api;
/
```
