Many business processes no longer work without I.T. and the dependence of businesses on their I.T. has grown tremendously, meaning we need robust and maintainable applications.

This forms the basis of well functioning off- or on-shoring strategy, as it allows quality assurance to be carried out efficiently at the source.

Scope This document applies to the PL/SQL and SQL language as used within ORACLE databases and tools, which access ORACLE databases. Document Conventions SQALE (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations) is a method to support the evaluation of a software application source code. It is a generic method, independent of the language and source code analysis tools.

Why are standards important For a machine executing a program, code formatting is of no importance. However, for the human eye, well-formatted code is much easier to read. Modern tools can help to implement format and coding rules. Implementing formatting and coding standards has the following advantages for PL/SQL development: Well-formatted code is easier to read, analyze and maintain (not only for the author but also for other developers). The developers do not have to define their own guidelines - it is already defined. The code has a structure that makes it easier to avoid making errors. The code is more efficient concerning performance and organization of the whole application. The code is more modular and thus easier to use for other applications. We have other standards This document only defines possible standards. These standards are not written in stone, but are meant as guidelines. If standards already exist, and they are different from those in this document, it makes no sense to change them. We do not agree with all your standards There are basically two types of standards. Non-controversial These standards make sense. There is no reason not to follow them. An example of this category is G-2150 : Avoid comparisons with NULL value, consider using IS [NOT] NULL. Controversial Almost every rule/guildeline falls into this category. An example of this category is 3 space indention . - Why not 2 or 4 or even 8? Why not use tabs? You can argue in favor of all these options. In most cases it does not really matter which option you choose. Being consistent is more important. In this case it will make the code easier to read. For very controversial rules, we have started to include the reasoning either as a footnote or directly in the text. Usually it is not helpful to open an issue on GitHub to request to change a highly controversial rule such as the one mentioned. For example, use 2 spaces instead of 3 spaces for an indentation. This leads to a discussion where the people in favor of 4 spaces start to argument as well. There is no right or wrong here. You just have to agree on a standard. More effective is to fork this repository and amend the standards to fit your needs/expectations.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1-introduction/introduction/#introduction","text":"This document describes rules and recommendations for developing applications using the PL/SQL & SQL Language.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1-introduction/introduction/#scope","text":"This document applies to the PL/SQL and SQL language as used within ORACLE databases and tools, which access ORACLE databases.","title":"Scope"},{"location":"1-introduction/introduction/#document-conventions","text":"SQALE (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations) is a method to support the evaluation of a software application source code.

Always choose meaningful and specific names. Avoid using abbreviations unless the full name is excessively long. Avoid long abbreviations. Abbreviations should be shorter than 5 characters. Any abbreviations must be widely known and accepted. Create a glossary with all accepted abbreviations. Never use ORACLE keywords as names. A list of ORACLEs keywords may be found in the dictionary view V$RESERVED_WORDS . Avoid adding redundant or meaningless prefixes and suffixes to identifiers. Example: CREATE TABLE emp_table . Always use one spoken language (e.g. English, German, French) for all objects in your application. Always use the same names for elements with the same meaning. Naming Conventions for PL/SQL In general, ORACLE is not case sensitive with names. A variable named personname is equal to one named PersonName, as well as to one named PERSONNAME. Some products (e.g. TMDA by Trivadis, APEX, OWB) put each name within double quotes (\") so ORACLE will treat these names to be case sensitive. Using case sensitive variable names force developers to use double quotes for each reference to the variable. Our recommendation is to write all names in lowercase and to avoid double quoted identifiers. A widely used convention is to follow a {prefix}variablecontent{suffix} pattern. The following table shows a possible set of naming conventions. Identifier Prefix Suffix Example Global Variable g_ g_version Local Variable l_ l_version Cursor c_ c_employees Record r_ r_employee Array / Table t_ t_employees Object o_ o_employee Cursor Parameter p_ p_empno In Parameter in_ in_empno Out Parameter out_ out_ename In/Out Parameter io_ io_employee Record Type Definitions r_ _type r_employee_type Array/Table Type Definitions t_ _type t_employees_type Exception e_ e_employee_exists Constants co_ co_empno Subtypes _type big_string_type Database Object Naming Conventions Never enclose object names (table names, column names, etc.) in double quotes to enforce mixed case or lower case object names in the data dictionary. Collection Type A collection type should include the name of the collected objects in their name. Furthermore, they should have the suffix _ct to identify it as a collection. Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: employees_ct orders_ct Column Singular name of what is stored in the column (unless the column data type is a collection, in this case you use plural 1 names) Add a comment to the database dictionary for every column. Check Constraint Table name or table abbreviation followed by the column and/or role of the check constraint, a _ck and an optional number suffix. Examples: employees_salary_min_ck orders_mode_ck DML / Instead of Trigger Choose a naming convention that includes: either the name of the object the trigger is added to, any of the triggering events: _br_iud for Before Row on Insert, Update and Delete _io_id for Instead of Insert and Delete or the name of the object the trigger is added to, the activity done by the trigger, the suffix _trg Examples: employees_br_iud orders_audit_trg orders_journal_trg Foreign Key Constraint Table abbreviation followed by referenced table abbreviation followed by a _fk and an optional number suffix. Examples: empl_dept_fk sct_icmd_ic_fk1 Function Name is built from a verb followed by a noun in general. Nevertheless, it is not sensible to call a function get_... as a function always gets something. The name of the function should answer the question \u201cWhat is the outcome of the function?\u201d Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Example: employee_by_id If more than one function provides the same outcome, you have to be more specific with the name. Index Indexes serving a constraint (primary, unique or foreign key) are named accordingly. Other indexes should have the name of the table and columns (or their purpose) in their name and should also have _idx as a suffix. Object Type The name of an object type is built by its content (singular) followed by a _ot suffix. Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Example: employee_ot Package Name is built from the content that is contained within the package. Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: employees_api - API for the employee table logging_up - Utilities including logging support Primary Key Constraint Table name or table abbreviation followed by the suffix _pk . Examples: employees_pk departments_pk sct_contracts_pk Procedure Name is built from a verb followed by a noun. The name of the procedure should answer the question \u201cWhat is done?\u201d Procedures and functions are often named with underscores between words because some editors write all letters in uppercase in the object tree, so it is difficult to read them. Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: calculate_salary set_hiredate check_order_state Sequence Name is built from the table name (or its abbreviation) the sequence serves as primary key generator and the suffix _seq or the purpose of the sequence followed by a _seq . Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: employees_seq order_number_seq Synonym Synonyms should be used to address an object in a foreign schema rather than to rename an object. Therefore, synonyms should share the name with the referenced object. System Trigger Name of the event the trigger is based on. Activity done by the trigger Suffix _trg Examples: ddl_audit_trg logon_trg Table Plural 1 name of what is contained in the table (unless the table is designed to always hold one row only \u2013 then you should use a singular name). Suffixed by _eb when protected by an editioning view. Add a comment to the database dictionary for every table and every column in the table. Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: employees departments countries_eb - table interfaced by an editioning view named countries sct_contracts sct_contract_lines sct_incentive_modules Temporary Table (Global Temporary Table) Naming as described for tables. Optionally suffixed by _tmp Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: employees_tmp contracts_tmp Unique Key Constraint Table name or table abbreviation followed by the role of the unique key constraint, a _uk and an optional number suffix. Examples: employees_name_uk departments_deptno_uk sct_contracts_uk sct_coli_uk sct_icmd_uk1 View Plural 1 name of what is contained in the view. Optionally suffixed by an indicator identifying the object as a view (mostly used, when a 1:1 view layer lies above the table layer) Editioning views are named like the original underlying table to avoid changing the existing application code when introducing edition based redefinition (EBR). Add a comment to the database dictionary for every view and every column. Optionally prefixed by a project abbreviation. Examples: active_orders orders_v - a view to the orders table countries - an editioning view for table countries_eb We see a table and a view as a collection. A jar containing beans is labeled \"beans\". In Java we call such a collection also \"beans\" ( List<Bean> beans ) and name an entry \"bean\" ( for (Bean bean : beans) {...} ). An entry of a table is a row (singular) and a table can contain an unbounded number of rows (plural). This and the fact that the Oracle database uses the same concept for their tables and views lead to the decision to use the plural to name a table or a view. \u21a9 \u21a9 \u21a9","title":"Naming Conventions"},{"location":"2-naming-conventions/naming-conventions/#naming-conventions","text":"","title":"Naming Conventions"},{"location":"2-naming-conventions/naming-conventions/#general-guidelines","text":"Never use names with a leading numeric character.

Halstead Metrics Calculation First, we need to compute the following numbers, given the program: n_1 n_1 = the number of distinct operators n_2 n_2 = the number of distinct operands N_1 N_1 = the total number of operators N_2 N_2 = the total number of operands From these numbers, five measures can be calculated: Program length: N = N_1 + N_2 N = N_1 + N_2 Program vocabulary: n = n_1 + n_2 n = n_1 + n_2 Volume: V = N \\cdot log_2 n V = N \\cdot log_2 n Difficulty: D = \\frac{n_1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{N_2}{n_2} D = \\frac{n_1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{N_2}{n_2} Effort: E = D \\cdot V E = D \\cdot V The difficulty measure D D is related to the difficulty of the program to write or understand, e.g. when doing code review. The volume measure V V describes the size of the implementation of an algorithm. McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity Description Cyclomatic complexity (or conditional complexity) is a software metric used to measure the complexity of a program. It directly measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Cyclomatic complexity is computed using the control flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods or classes within a program. The cyclomatic complexity of a section of source code is the count of the number of linearly independent paths through the source code. For instance, if the source code contains no decision points, such as IF statements or FOR loops, the complexity would be 1, since there is only a single path through the code. If the code has a single IF statement containing a single condition there would be two paths through the code, one path where the IF statement is evaluated as TRUE and one path where the IF statement is evaluated as FALSE. Calculation Mathematically, the cyclomatic complexity of a structured program is defined with reference to a directed graph containing the basic blocks of the program, with an edge between two basic blocks if control may pass from the first to the second (the control flow graph of the program). The complexity is then defined as: M = E - N + 2P M = E - N + 2P where M M = cyclomatic complexity E E = the number of edges of the graph N N = the number of nodes of the graph P P = the number of connected components. Take, for example, a control flow graph of a simple program. The program begins executing at the red node, then enters a loop (group of three nodes immediately below the red node). On exiting the loop, there is a conditional statement (group below the loop), and finally the program exits at the blue node. For this graph, E = 9 E = 9 , N = 8 N = 8 and P = 1 P = 1 , so the cyclomatic complexity of the program is 3 3 . BEGIN FOR i IN 1..3 LOOP dbms_output.put_line('in loop'); END LOOP; -- IF 1 = 1 THEN dbms_output.put_line('yes'); END IF; -- dbms_output.put_line('end'); END; / For a single program (or subroutine or method), P is always equal to 1. Cyclomatic complexity may, however, be applied to several such programs or subprograms at the same time (e.g., to all of the methods in a class), and in these cases P will be equal to the number of programs in question, as each subprogram will appear as a disconnected subset of the graph. It can be shown that the cyclomatic complexity of any structured program with only one entrance point and one exit point is equal to the number of decision points (i.e., 'if' statements or conditional loops) contained in that program plus one. Cyclomatic complexity may be extended to a program with multiple exit points; in this case it is equal to: \\pi = s + 2 \\pi = s + 2 Where \\pi \\pi is the number of decision points in the program, and s s is the number of exit points.","title":"Complexity Analysis"},{"location":"5-complexity-analysis/complexity-analysis/#complexity-analysis","text":"Using software metrics like complexity analysis will guide you towards maintainable and testable pieces of code by reducing the complexity and splitting the code into smaller chunks.","title":"Complexity Analysis"},{"location":"5-complexity-analysis/complexity-analysis/#halstead-metrics","text":"","title":"Halstead Metrics"},{"location":"5-complexity-analysis/complexity-analysis/#calculation","text":"First, we need to compute the following numbers, given the program: n_1 n_1 = the number of distinct operators n_2 n_2 = the number of distinct operands N_1 N_1 = the total number of operators N_2 N_2 = the total number of operands From these numbers, five measures can be calculated: Program length: N = N_1 + N_2 N = N_1 + N_2 Program vocabulary: n = n_1 + n_2 n = n_1 + n_2 Volume: V = N \\cdot log_2 n V = N \\cdot log_2 n Difficulty: D = \\frac{n_1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{N_2}{n_2} D = \\frac{n_1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{N_2}{n_2} Effort: E = D \\cdot V E = D \\cdot V The difficulty measure D D is related to the difficulty of the program to write or understand, e.g. when doing code review.
