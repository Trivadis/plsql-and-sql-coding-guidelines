# Trivadis PL/SQL &amp; SQL Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

Trivadis published their guidelines for PL/SQL &amp; SQL in 2009 in the context of the DOAG conference in Nuremberg. Since then these guidelines - written in Microsoft Word - have been continously extended and improved. We think it is time to make these guidelines more adaptable for the individual #SmartDB application needs and to simplify the continous improvement of these guidelines.

The next step will be to convert the existing guidelines to a set of Markdown files and use Jekyll to generate the guidelines as static HTML files or PDF.
