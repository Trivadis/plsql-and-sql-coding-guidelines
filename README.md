# Trivadis PL/SQL &amp; SQL Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

Trivadis published their guidelines for PL/SQL &amp; SQL in 2009 in the context of the DOAG conference in Nuremberg. Since then these guidelines have been continuously extended and improved. Now they are managed as a set of markdown files. This makes the the guidelines more adaptable for individual application needs and simplifies the continous improvement.

In 2019, Rich Soule of Insum forked this repository and updated some of the rules.
